# Changelog

## 1.2.0

- Keep the spaces that belong to a value. A `NOTE` whose text began with spaces
  was losing them, and `CONC` continuations silently changed the text they
  rejoined.
- Stop the hint for a broken pointer from covering the note. It named every
  matching record in the file and offered a quick fix for each; it now names ten
  and says how many more there are, and the tooltip is capped and scrolls.
  Autocomplete still offers every record.
- Hover no longer shows stray asterisks around the tag description.
- Colour and validate large files without the editor stalling: highlighting is
  built for the visible lines rather than the whole note, diagnostics refresh
  once typing pauses, and validation cost no longer grows with the number of
  records times the number of lines.

## 1.1.0

- Accept application-defined extension tags (`_XXXX`) instead of flagging every
  one of them as an unknown tag. Notes holding files exported by other genealogy
  applications no longer fill with false warnings.
- Read extension tag declarations from `HEAD.SCHMA` in GEDCOM 7 documents: hover
  shows the URI a tag is bound to, and autocomplete offers the declared tags.
- Warn when a GEDCOM 7 document uses an extension tag it never declares in
  `HEAD.SCHMA`. GEDCOM 5.5.1 files, which have no such structure, are unaffected.
- Stop offering top-level record tags as completions inside a structure whose
  type cannot be resolved.
